Upton
==========
Upton is a framework for easy web-scraping with a useful debug mode that doesn't hammer your target's servers. It does the repetitive parts of writing scrapers, so you only have to write the unique parts for each site.

Documentation
----------------------

With Upton, you can scrape complex sites to a CSV in just one line of code.

```ruby
Upton::Scraper.new("http://website.com/list_of_stories.html").
    scrape_to_csv("output.csv", &Upton::Utils.list("#comments li a.commenter-name", :css))
```

Just specify a URL to a list of links -- or simply a list of links --, an XPath expression or CSS selector for the links and a block of what to do with the content of the pages you've scraped. Upton comes with some pre-written blocks (Procs, technically) for scraping simple lists and tables, like the `list` function above.

Upton operates on the theory that, for most scraping projects, you need to scrape two types of pages:

1. Instance pages, which are the goal of your scraping, e.g. job listings or news articles.
1. Index pages, which list instance pages. For example, a job search site's search page or a newspaper's homepage.

For more complex use cases, subclass `Upton::Scraper` and override the relevant methods. If you're scraping links from an API, you would override `get_index`; if you need to log in before scraping a site or do something special with the scraped instance page, you would override `get_instance`.

The `get_instance` and `get_index` methods use a protected method `get_page(url)` which, well, gets a page. That's not very special. The more interesting part is that `get_page(url, stash)` transparently stashes the response of each request if the second parameter, `stash`, is true. Whenever you repeat a request (with `true` as the second parameter), the stashed HTML is returned without going to the server. This is helpful in the development stages of a project when you're testing some aspect of the code and don't want to hit a server each time. If you are using `get_instance` and `get_index`, this can be en/disabled per instance of `Upton::Scraper` or its subclasses with the `@debug` option. Setting the `stash` parameter of the `get_page` method should only be used if you've overridden `get_instance` or `get_index` in a subclass.

Upton also sleeps (by default) 30 seconds between non-stashed requests, to reduce load on the server you're scraping. This is configurable with the `@sleep_time_between_requests` option.

Upton can handle pagination too. You can override the `next_index_page_url` and `next_instance_page_url` methods; Upton will get each page's URL returned by these functions and return their contents.

Examples
----------------------
If you want to scrape ProPublica's website with Upton, this is how you'd do it. (Scraping our [RSS feed](http://feeds.propublica.org/propublica/main) would be smarter, but not every site has a full-text RSS feed...)

```ruby
Upton::Scraper.new("http://www.propublica.org", "section#river section h1 a", :css).scrape do |article_string|
  puts "here is the full text of the ProPublica article: \n #{article_string}"
  #or, do other stuff here.
end
```

Simple sites can be scraped with pre-written `list` block in `Upton::Utils', as below:

```ruby
> u = Upton::Scraper.new("http://nytimes.com", "ul.headlinesOnly a", :css)
> u.scrape_to_csv("output.csv", &Upton::Utils.list("h6.byline", :css))
```

A `table` block also exists in `Upton::Utils` to scrape tables to an array of arrays, as below:

```ruby
> u = Upton::Scraper.new(["http://website.com/story.html"])
> u.scrape(&Upton::Utils.table("//table[2]", :xpath))
[["Jeremy", "$8.00"], ["John Doe", "$15.00"]]
```


Contributing
----------------------
I'd love to hear from you if you're using Upton. I also appreciate your suggestions/complaints/bug reports/pull requests. If you're interested, check out the issues tab or [drop me a note](http://github.com/jeremybmerrill).

In particular, if you have a common, *abstract* use case, please add them to [lib/utils.rb](https://github.com/propublica/upton/blob/master/lib/utils.rb). Check out the `table_to_csv` and `list_to_csv` methods for examples.

(The pull request process is pretty easy. Fork the project in Github (or via the `git` CLI), make your changes, then submit a pull request on Github.) 

Why "Upton"
----------------------
Upton Sinclair was a pioneering, muckraking journalist who is most famous for _The Jungle_, a novel portraying the reality of immigrant labor struggles in Chicago meatpacking plants at the start of the 1900s. Upton, the gem, sprang out of a ProPublica project pertaining to labor issues.
