module Upton
  ##
  # *Upton* is a framework for easy web-scraping with a useful debug mode 
  # that doesn't hammer your target's servers. It does the repetitive parts of 
  # writing scrapers, so you only have to write the unique parts for each site.
  #
  # Upton operates on the theory that, for most scraping projects, you need to
  # scrape two types of pages:
  # 
  # 1. Index pages, which list instance pages. For example, a job search 
  #     site's search page or a newspaper's homepage.
  # 2. Instance pages, which represent the goal of your scraping, e.g.
  #     job listings or news articles.
  #
  # Upton::Scraper can be used as-is for basic use-cases by:
  # 1. specifying the pages to be scraped in `new` as an index page 
  #      or as an Array of URLs.
  # 2.  supplying a block to `scrape` or `scrape_to_csv` or using a pre-build 
  #      block from Upton::Utils.
  # For more complicated cases; subclass Upton::Scraper 
  #    e.g. +MyScraper < Upton::Scraper+ and override various methods.
  ##
  class Scraper

    attr_accessor :verbose, :debug, :sleep_time_between_requests, :stash_folder, :url_array

    ##
    # This is the main user-facing method for a basic scraper.
    # Call +scrape+ with a block; this block will be called on 
    # the text of each instance page, (and optionally, its URL and its index
    # in the list of instance URLs returned by +get_index+).

    # +index_url_or_array+: A list of string URLs, OR
    #              the URL of the page containing the list of instances.
    # +selector+: The XPath expression or CSS selector that specifies the 
    #              anchor elements within the page, if a url is specified for 
    #              the previous argument.
    # +selector_method+: +:xpath+ or +:css+. By default, +:xpath+.
    #
    # These options are a shortcut. If you plan to override +get_index+, you
    # do not need to set them.
    # If you don't specify a selector, the first argument will be treated as a
    # list of URLs.
